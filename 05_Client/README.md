# Client
This section is for all things related to building the client. Can be either a web app, desktop app or mobile app.
## Web App
The web app is the easiest and most familiar of the three clients. It consists of being rendered through any of the popular browsers 
(IE Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

In the previous [server](http://google.com) section there were instructions to program the rendering of pages. In addition, the jQuery
library was used to facilitate **_ajax_** calls to the server. In the [sockets](http://google.com) section, we switched to using 
WebSockets.
