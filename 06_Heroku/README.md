# Heroku
Heroku is a cloud application platform designed for developers to bypass the burden of provisioning, configuring, and managing 
their own servers. With Heroku the process is abstracted and as a developer your focus remains on the code; HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Heroku provides a free-tier for testing, [sign-up](https://signup.heroku.com/) and give it a try.
